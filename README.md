Problem Statement: 
A. Write a pseudocode for a graph search agent. Represent the agent in the form of a flow chart. Clearly mention all the implementation details with reasons.\\

B. Write a collection of functions imitating the environment for Puzzle-8. 

C. Describe what is Iterative Deepening Search.

D. Considering the cost associated with every move to be the same (uniform cost), write a function which can backtrack 
and produce the path taken to reach the goal state from the source/ initial state.

E. Generate Puzzle-8 instances with the goal state at depth “d”.

F. Prepare a table indicating the memory and time requirements to solve Puzzle-8 instances (depth “d”) using your graph search agent.
